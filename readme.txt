The point of this site was to explore and learn how to implement bootstrap and figma in my workflow. The site contains information about me and
some of my interests and has the theme of my favourite football team Hammarby IF. I tried to use the bootstrap classes as often as I saw fit and
the finished product came out pretty similar to how I planned it in figma. One of the problems I found using bootstrap was that there were no small
increments for size and/or position for elements. I solved this by having more div elements than I initially had planned so that with for example 
margin between elements had double the amount of increments. Having more div elements also made it possible to have the picture in the position I 
wanted it to be. First it did not fit at all but by putting it in a div that had the right position and width.
